# Daily Insights Analysis

This project is a comprehensive analysis of daily habits and their impact on personal happiness. Over the course of a year, I tracked several aspects of my daily life, including:

- **Sleep Time**: Hours of sleep logged each day.
- **Screen Time**: Time spent using my phone.
- **Bedtime and Wake-up Time**: The specific times I went to bed and woke up.
- **Daily Happiness Score**: A subjective evaluation of how happy or satisfied I felt at the end of each day.

The goal of this project is to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights from this data, helping me better understand the habits that influence my well-being.
